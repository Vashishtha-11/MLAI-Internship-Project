🧭 Step 1: Prepare Your Project Folder

Create a local folder (e.g., EarthquakePrediction) containing:

EarthquakePrediction/
│
├── EarthquakePrediction.ipynb
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
└── data/                (optional if your notebook uses a dataset)

📘 Step 2: Write a README.md

Here’s a sample README.md you can use directly:

# 🌋 Earthquake Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of earthquakes based on seismic data using Machine Learning techniques.  
Developed as part of a data science internship project.

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature extraction and selection
- Model training using algorithms such as Random Forest / Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall)
- Visualization of seismic activity trends

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Project Structure


EarthquakePrediction/
├── EarthquakePrediction.ipynb
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
└── data/


## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/EarthquakePrediction.git


Navigate into the project folder:

cd EarthquakePrediction


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

📊 Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 90%, enabling better prediction of earthquake-prone areas and supporting risk mitigation strategies.
